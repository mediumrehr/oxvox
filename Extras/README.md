### OX VOX Extras
bmp2bytes.js is a node script to convert a 128 x 64 single color bmp file to a list of bytes that can be dropped into an array. This is a quick tool to convert images to the appropriate format to be shown on the display.

Also included are the individual images used in the oxvox and a high resolution version of the Ox Vox boot screen.
